    <h1>About the Committee to Protect Journalists</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      <img src="CPJlogo.png" alt="CPJLogo">
      The Committee to Protect Journalists is an independent, nonprofit organization that
      promotes press freedom worldwide. We defend the right of journalists to report the
      news without fear of reprisal.
    </p>

    <p class="subheader">CPJ's History</p>

    <p class="history">
      The Committee to Protect Journalists was founded in 1981 by
      a group of U.S. correspondents who realized they could not ignore
      the plight of colleagues whose reporting put them in peril on a daily
      basis.
    </p>

    <p class="history">
      The idea that journalists around the world should come
      together to defend the rights of colleagues working in repressive and
      dangerous environments led to CPJ's first advocacy campaign in
      1982. At the time, three British journalists-Simon Winchester, Ian
      Mather, and Tony Prime-were arrested in Argentina while covering the
      Falklands War. A letter from CPJ Honorary Chairman Walter Cronkite
      helped spring them from prison.
    </p>

    <p class="history">
      Since then, CPJ's mission involves not only journalists but
      anyone who cherishes the value of information for a free society.
