      <td>Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Boston Braves</td>
      <td class="graph">
        Home runs. The baseball we watch today is Babe Ruth's game. Many players make an impact,
        a few become folk heroes, but nobody changed a sport like Ruth did when he joined the
        Yankees and transformed baseball into a game of power. No player dominated his era like
        Ruth. He led his league in home runs 12 times, batting title. And his career totals could
        have been even higher had he not missed three prime seasons to serve in World War II.

    <tr>
      <td>Ty Cobb</td>
      <td>Center Field</td>
      <td>Detroit Tigers, Philadelphia Athletics</td>
      <td class="graph">
        In an era when batting average reigned supreme, Cobb was the greatest of 'em all.
        He won a record 12 batting titles, hit .400 three times and finished with the highest
        lifetime average in MLB history. He played a game where you had to outthink the opponent,
        not outslug. Nearly 100 years since he played his final game, the image of Cobb remains
        vivid: the sharpened spikes, the aggression, the fiery temperament.

    <tr>
      <td>Ted Williams</td>
      <td>Left Field</td>
      <td>Boston Red Sox</td>
      <td class="graph">
        Williams was probably the greatest hitter who ever lived, largely because of the
        astronomical numbers he put up but also because of how he revolutionized the approach
        to hitting. His book, "The Science of Hitting," is still referenced today. Williams boasts
        the highest on-base percentage in baseball history and is the last hitter to reach a .400
        batting average.

    <tr>
      <td>Willie Mays</td>
      <td>Center Field</td>
      <td>Birmingham Black Barons, New York/San Francisco Giants, New York Mets</td>
      <td class="graph">
        Best known for "The Catch" in the 1954 World Series, Mays epitomized athleticism,
        grace and ingenuity. He won 12 Gold Gloves and was an elite hitter and baserunner,
        leading the majors in stolen bases for four straight years. His unmatched skill set
        made him the greatest center fielder who ever lived.

    <tr>
      <td>Hank Aaron</td>
      <td>Right Field</td>
      <td>Indianapolis Clowns, Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves, Milwaukee Brewers</td>
      <td class="graph">
        Aaron broke Babe Ruth's career home run record with No. 715 on April 8, 1974,
        an iconic moment in American history. But Aaron was more than a power hitter.
        He finished with a .305 lifetime average, 3,771 hits and a career RBI record that
        still stands today.
