<title>Small Town Summer</title>

<body>

<p>
The sun sinks slow behind the trees<br>
Dust kicks up on old back roads<br>
Windows down and country songs<br>
Playing soft on the radio
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Fireflies light up the backyard air<br>
Bare feet running through the grass<br>
Laughing like we’ve got all night<br>
Like we’re praying it never passes
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Pickup trucks and faded jeans<br>
Names carved in the water tower paint<br>
Hearts too young to know goodbye<br>
Too wild to ever feel afraid
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Maybe someday we’ll grow up and leave<br>
Chasing dreams in bigger towns<br>
But a piece of me will stay right here<br>
Where love is simple and slow goes time
</p>
